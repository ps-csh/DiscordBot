# DiscordBot
Bot for Discord, made as a personal hobby project.<br>
A work-in-progress, implementing features I think would be neat.

<b>Features</b>

- Storing information to use in commands in a portable SQLite database
- Dependency Injection and Entity Framework in a WPF application
- Rate limiting calls to Discord API using semaphores
- Interacting will other RESTful web APIs
- Automatically loading commands in the assembly using attributes and reflection
- Loading image thumbnails from Windows using ShellFiles, displaying them in a listbox
